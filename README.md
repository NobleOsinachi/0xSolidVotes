# Solidity 101

This repository contains a collection of Solidity code snippets that can be used as a starting point for building decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum blockchain. Solidity is a programming language used for writing smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Solidity, you'll need to install a Solidity compiler. The recommended compiler version for this repository is Solidity 0.8.3 or higher. You can find installation instructions for the Solidity compiler on the official Solidity website.
