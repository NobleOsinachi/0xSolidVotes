# SolidVotes

SolidVotes is a decentralized voting system that uses blockchain technology to ensure the immutability and transparency of votes. The project was inspired by the 2023 Nigeria election, which was plagued by vote rigging and inflation.

## Overview

The goal of SolidVotes is to provide a secure and trustworthy voting system that can be used in various settings, such as elections, polls, and surveys. By leveraging blockchain technology, SolidVotes eliminates the need for a centralized authority to manage and validate the voting process, thus reducing the risk of fraud and manipulation.

## Features

- Immutable and transparent voting records
- Decentralized and trustless architecture
- Secure and encrypted data transmission
- Easy integration with existing systems

## How it works

SolidVotes uses a distributed network of nodes to validate and record votes. When a voter casts their vote, it is encrypted and transmitted to the network, where it is validated by a consensus algorithm. Once the vote is verified, it is added to the blockchain, where it becomes a permanent and tamper-proof record.
